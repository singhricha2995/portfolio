    The project deals with development of Python code for single imputation of missing data using a generalized regression neural network for an unlabelled numerical and categorical dataset.The incomplete data set will be divided into a complete and incomplete dataset. SAGA algorithm will be applied to choose the optimal subsets.The subsets shall be used to train the GRNN, and the model will be fed to impute the missing data. Further we will calculate the NRMS (Normalized Root mean Square) value for numerical datasets and AE value for categorical dataset by comparing the imputed data sets with the original data sets.Moreover, the algorithm shall be analyzed for runtime against the data size and dimensions.

    Obstacle Avoiding Robot will automatically sense the obstacle and overcome it on its path. the development and implementation involves movement of the robot moving in the forward direction until there is no object or obstacle detected in the path. Once the obstacle is detected the robot will move sideways either in left direction or right randomly to avoid collision. When the object is detected the servo motor arm will change its direction either left or right. If there is no object the servo motor arm will remain in the forward direction.

    Used MATLAB and Simulink environment to develop and implement an adaptive cruise control system for vehicles that automatically adjusts the vehicle speed to maintain a safe distance from vehicles ahead. The idea of building an Adaptive Cruise Control aims to let the driver in a host car set a traveling speed and automatically maintain a constant distance from the preceding car with the help of ultrasonic sensor. This project comprises of ACC system operating at moderate to high velocity, 40 and above.
